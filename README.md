## Learning Activities & Resources

This week I worked on creating a static website called *The Quiet Atlas* using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The task involved revising foundational web development concepts, including how HTML structures a webpage, how CSS controls layout and styling, and how Bootstrap can be used to quickly create responsive designs.

As it had been a few years since I last worked on web development, I spent time revisiting how to start a website from scratch, including setting up the correct file structure, linking CSS files, and using external libraries through CDNs. I also learned how to deploy a website using GitHub Pages, which allowed me to host the site publicly for the first time.

To support my learning, I spent time watching YouTube tutorial videos and reviewing provided learning materials that explained how websites work, how Bootstrap components function, and how pages connect together through navigation links.

**Resources used:**
- Course learning materials on web development
- YouTube tutorials on HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
- GitHub Pages documentation
- Bootstrap documentation (CDN usage and layout system)

## Estimated Hours

I spent approximately **2–4 hours per day** on this task.  
This time included:
- Watching tutorial videos
- Revising HTML and CSS concepts
- Building and styling the website
- Debugging layout and file structure issues
- Publishing the website using GitHub Pages

## Content Insights

Revisiting HTML and CSS helped refresh my understanding of how websites are structured and styled. I was reminded of the importance of proper file organisation, such as keeping images, CSS files, and HTML pages in separate folders and correctly linking them together.

Using Bootstrap made it much easier to create a responsive layout without writing large amounts of custom CSS. Components such as the grid system, navigation bar, and spacing utilities helped speed up development while still allowing room for creative design.

Although JavaScript was not heavily used in this project, revising how it fits into a website alongside HTML and CSS helped reinforce how these technologies work together. Overall, the process helped rebuild confidence in web development skills that I had not used for several years.

## Career / Employability / Learning Insights

This task highlighted the value of revisiting foundational skills, especially when returning to a technology after a long break. While it took some time to remember how to start a website, the learning curve became easier once the basics were re-established.

Publishing the website through GitHub Pages was an exciting experience, as it demonstrated how development work can be shared publicly and professionally. This is a valuable skill for future employment, as it allows projects to be showcased in a portfolio.

I also found that combining learning materials with external tutorials was an effective approach for me. Watching videos alongside practical implementation helped reinforce concepts more clearly, and this strategy is something I plan to continue using in future learning tasks.
